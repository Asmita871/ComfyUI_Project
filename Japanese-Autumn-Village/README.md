Fig 4.1 – output
 
 The image shows a ComfyUI workflow for Stable Diffusion, where a text prompt (“A serene Japanese village during autumn, with vibrant red and orange maple trees, a small wooden bridge over a koi pond, and a traditional tea house in the background. Soft golden sunlight, peaceful and detailed.”) is processed through nodes like CLIP Text Encode, KSampler, and VAE Decode to generate and save an AI-generated image.
