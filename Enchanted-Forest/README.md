Fig 3.1 – output
 The image shows a ComfyUI workflow for Stable Diffusion, where a text prompt (“A magical forest at twilight, glowing mushrooms, fireflies lighting up the misty air, an ancient tree with a glowing portal at its base, surrounded by enchanted creatures. Fantasy, highly detailed, dreamlike atmosphere.”) is processed through nodes like CLIP Text Encode, KSampler, and VAE Decode to generate and save an AI-generated image.
