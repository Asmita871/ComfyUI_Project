Fig 2.1 – output
The image shows a ComfyUI workflow for Stable Diffusion, where a text prompt (“A futuristic cyberpunk city at night, glowing neon lights, flying cars, and a mysterious figure in a high-tech suit standing on a rooftop, overlooking the skyline. Ultra-detailed, cinematic lighting, sci-fi atmosphere”) is processed through nodes like CLIP Text Encode, KSampler, and VAE Decode to generate and save an AI-generated image.
